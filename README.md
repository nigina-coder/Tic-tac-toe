# Tic-tac-toe
Welcome to my Tic-tac-Toe game project.This is the game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. Once the user chooses the mark, he wants to play with, computer automatically is assigned to be the second user. The user who succeeds in placing three of their marks in horizontal, vertical and diagonal is the winner of the game and game board will be automatically replaced by game results and user have an option to play again if he wants. 

For interface of the game I have used HTML and CSS. For game logic and making a small AI by assigning the computer as the second user I have used Javascript. 
I hope you will enjoy my version of Tic-Tac-Toe
